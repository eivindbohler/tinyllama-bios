ABOUT:

This utility will help to create irq_table.c file, that is very hard to create
manually, specialy when you are testing new motherboards, changing your
hardware often, placing new cards, etc..

USAGE:

Steps
1. make distclean;
2. make getpir
3. ./getpir

   Will dump irq table to the file called irq_tables.c, ready to use with
   coreboot. Just move the file to corresponding place in the coreboot tree.


4. CHECKING CUSTOM irq_tables.c:

   make checkpir
   ./checkpir

   checkpir.c Will verify the irq_tables.c, currently it only checks the
   checksum. In case of wrong checksum, a good value is proposed, so you can
   edit irq_tables.c manualy and replace checksum.


Do not run make checkpir and ./checkpir directly because it needs to be linked
to irq_table.o first.
